               <h2>About Design</h2>
               <p>A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the
                  implementation
                  of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype,
                  product or process.The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design. In some cases, the
                  direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some
                  engineering,
                  coding, and graphic design) may also be considered to be a design activity. The design usually has to
                  satisfy certain goals and constraints, may take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or
                  socio-political considerations, and is expected to interact with a certain environment. Major examples
                  of
                  designs include architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams,
                  and
                  sewing patterns.[1]

                  The person who produces a design is called a designer, which is a term generally used for people who
                  work
                  professionally in one of the various design areas—usually specifying which area is being dealt with
                  (such
                  as a fashion designer, product designer, web designer or interior designer), but also others such as
                  architects and engineers. A designer's sequence of activities is called a design process, possibly
                  using
                  design methods.</p>

               <h2>What Is a Front-End Developer?</h2>
               <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML,
                  CSS
                  and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them
                  directly.
                  The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create
                  the
                  front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the
                  field is developing.

                  The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the
                  information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact
                  that
                  users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the
                  designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that
                  their
                  site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems
                  (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of
                  the
                  developer.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-content">
               <h2>What is Backend Development?</h2>
               <p>Back-end Development refers to the server-side development. It focuses on databases, scripting,
                  website
                  architecture. It contains behind-the-scene activities that occur when performing any action on a
                  website.
                  It can be an account login or making a purchase from an online store. Code written by back-end
                  developers
                  helps browsers to communicate with database information.As mentioned above, backend development is
                  what
                  keeps the internet running behind the scenes.

                  Backend developers are primarily focused on how a website works. They write code that focuses on the
                  functionality and logic powering the application they’re working on, and the technology they work on
                  is
                  never directly seen by users.

                  The tech of the back end is a combination of servers, applications, and databases.

                  Responsibilities of backend programmers could involve writing APIs, writing code to interact with a
                  database, creating libraries, working on business processes and data architecture, and much more. It
                  often depends on the specific role and company.</p>

               <h2>What Is a Content Management System (CMS)?</h2>
               <p>A content management system, often abbreviated as CMS, is software that helps users create, manage,
                  and
                  modify content on a website without the need for specialized technical knowledge.

                  In simpler language, a content management system is a tool that helps you build a website without
                  needing
                  to write all the code from scratch (or even know how to code at all).

                  Instead of building your own system for creating web pages, storing images, and other functions, the
                  content management system handles all that basic infrastructure stuff for you so that you can focus on
                  more forward-facing parts of your website.

                  Beyond websites, you can also find content management systems for other functions – like document
                  management.</p>
